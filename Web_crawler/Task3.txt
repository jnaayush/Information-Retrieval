For focused crawling, I considered these as targets or positive identification of urls:
1. when the word is present in the url and anchor text in the following manner:
    1.1. variation of word containing capital characters are present
    1.2. word start with the focus text

To handle these variations in url:
1. I made the complete url in lower case
2. split the url around '_' as they new words are separated by '_' and also split across '-'
3. for every word in splitted url ,I checked if the word began with focus text
4. I added unprocessed url to the list if the above condition was met.

1. I made the complete text in lower case
2. split the url around ' ' as they new words are separated by ' '
3. for every word in splitted text ,I checked if the word began with focus text
4. I added unprocessed url to the list if the above condition was met.
